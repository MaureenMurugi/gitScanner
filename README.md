# GitScanner

## Description

> GitScanner is an application that displays a user's Github account by displaying, the user's username, profile photo and the public repositories, on the landing page.

> The user is also able to search for other users and their repositories on Github and display the information.

> The project uses the GitHub API to retrieve the data, with the use of an APIkey, then a HTTPService to display this information.

## BDD

1. The user opens the project, to a landing page that displays, a profile, which includes an avatar photo, username,bio and the repositories of a user, as from their Github accounts.
2. The user can open any repo and access it to the Github account.
3. With the use of router-outlets, the user is able to open search page, where they can search for a user with their repositories.

## How it works

>On launching the website, the landing page includes my personal profile as it is on Github.

> The profile displays,in two card-elements, the username,the number of public repositories and the time the account was created. The second card on the landing page includes all the repositories present in the users Github account.

> The Nav-bar contains two routes; the profile, which is also the landing page and search route.

> On search route, the application allows, the user to search a name/account present on Github, on click button the user is able, to view the account username, number of public repositories and time. In a second card the user is able to view all the public repositories of the account searched.
